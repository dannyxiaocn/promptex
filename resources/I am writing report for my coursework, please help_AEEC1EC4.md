# I am writing report for my coursework, please help

I am writing report for my coursework, please help me: 
1. check if all things are covered; 2. improve my contents. The coursework instructions are in info/MPhil Dis Course Materials 2025.md; My implementations are  in bx242/module3, where jupytor notebooks (ex3.2b.ipynb, ex3.2c.ipynb) serving as a main function, displaying results, and write temporary summaries (Which is very important! Please make sure this is carefully checked); My report is in report.typ. The images are in images/ please check the task3*.png.

Please directly modify the report. You can also include some code snippet in it.
Please first focus on the Module 3 Exercise 3.2. Let's do this step by step!
For Pseudocode I mean still in python (to show it is code) but make it more human readable
Also, instead of making it separate, please make it integrated with the main report.
Please refer to report module 2, to see how report contents are structured, code snippet is integrated with main content, figure citation, and contents structure (Please avoid redundant contents but make sure the completeness).
Please remove the technical summary part and only keeps the content in Discussion and Learning Outcomes ( and what you have learned doing this coursework). Please remove the Introduction/Overall part(if have), and merge the contents inside the main reports.
